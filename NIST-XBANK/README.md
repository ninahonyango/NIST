# üìñ NIST CSF Implementation Plan For X Bank (Fictional Company)

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for a fictional organization, **X Bank**. It demonstrates how organizations can assess and improve their cybersecurity posture using structured risk analysis, mapped controls, and policy development.

---

## üìö Overview

The implementation covers the five NIST CSF core functions:

- **Identify**  
- **Protect**  
- **Detect**  
- **Respond**  
- **Recover**

---

## üîß Tools, Techniques and Framework Used

- NIST CSF Core Funtions & Subcategories
- Risk Register Development (Excel)
- NIST CSF Subcategory Control Mapping (Excel)
- Security Policy Writing & Documentation (PDF)
- Implementation Timeline & Appendix References
- Security Best Practices & Compliance Principles

---
## üß† Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates how to:

- Apply the NIST CSF practically in a fictional company setting
- Evaluate risks and document them in a structured risk register
- Map existing/planned controls to CSF subcategories
- Draft enforceable cybersecurity policies
- Document, organize, and present cybersecurity strategy professionally

---

## üìú Policies Included

Each policy includes purpose, scope, policy, responsible parties, and enforcement clauses in alignment with NIST CSF subcategories.

- Asset Management Policy *(Identify - ID.AM-1, ID.AM-2)*
- Access Control Policy *(Protect - PR.AC-1)*
- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) *(Protect - PR.AT-1)*
- Security Awareness & Training *(Protect - PR.AT-1)*
- Incident Response Policy *(RS.RP-1, RS.CO-1)*
- Backup & Recovery Policy *(Recover - RC.RP-1)*
- Business Continuity Policy *(Recover - RC.RP-1)*

---

## üóìÔ∏è Implementation Timeline

A detailed phased timeline is documented in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework PDF (Appendix A), with milestones for risk identification, policy rollout, training, and periodic reviews.

The implementation plan will be reviewed annually. Metrics and ownership of tasks are documented to 
ensure continuous improvement and successful measurement.
